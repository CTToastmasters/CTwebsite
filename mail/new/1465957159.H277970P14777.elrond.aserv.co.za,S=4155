Hello Web Admin, I noticed that your On-Page SEO is is missing a few factor=
s, for one you do not use all three H tags in your post, also I notice that=
 you are not using bold or italics properly in your SEO optimization. On-Pa=
ge SEO means more now than ever since the new Google update: Panda. No long=
er are backlinks and simply pinging or sending out a RSS feed the key to ge=
tting Google PageRank or Alexa Rankings, You now NEED On-Page SEO. So what =
is good On-Page SEO?First your keyword must appear in the title.Then it mus=
t appear in the URL.You have to optimize your keyword and make sure that it=
 has a nice keyword density of 3-5% in your article with relevant LSI (Late=
nt Semantic Indexing). Then you should spread all H1,H2,H3 tags in your art=
icle.Your Keyword should appear in your first paragraph and in the last sen=
tence of the page. You should have relevant usage of Bold and italics of yo=
ur keyword.There should be one internal link to a page on your blog and you=
 should have one image with an alt tag that has your keyword....wait there'=
s even more Now what if i told you there was a simple Wordpress plugin that=
 does all the On-Page SEO, and automatically for you? That's right AUTOMATI=
CALLY, just watch this 4minute video for more information at. <a href=3D"ht=
