message: Dear Toastmasters
I am a first year student at the University of Cape Town and would love to join the Toastmasters club. I have ambitions of becoming a keynote speaker someday yet i have noticed a lot of challenges keeping me back. I believe that joining Toastmaster will the beginning of the beginning.
Please let me know how I can join the club.
Kind Regards
Lebogang -
