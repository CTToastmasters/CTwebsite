Hi my name is Natalie and I just wanted to send you a quick message here instead of calling you. I came to your 10 PUBLIC SPEAKING TIPS website and noticed you could have a lot more hits. I have found that the key to running a successful website is making sure the visitors you are getting are interested in your website topic. There is a company that you can get keyword targeted visitors from and they let you try the service for free for 7 days. I managed to get over 300 targeted visitors to day to my site.
