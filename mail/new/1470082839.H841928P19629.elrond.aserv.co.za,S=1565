message: Dear Toastmasters
I am currently a first year student at UCT. I would like to improve my Public speaking abilities and improve my confidence levels in as far as being myself is concerned. 
Through reading what the club offers, I would really love to join the community and better my chances of becoming a Keynote Speaker in future.
I hope to hear from you soon as to how I can join.

Regards
Lebogang Masekoameng (UCT) -
