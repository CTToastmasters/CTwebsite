message: Dear Toastmasters
I am currently a first year student at the University of Cape Town and I would like to learn how to speak fluently and articulate myself properly as I have ambitions to become a keynote speaker one day. I have noticed challenges in my speech and would really like to improve with your help on my side.
Kind Regards
Lebogang -
